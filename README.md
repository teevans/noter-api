# Noter
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/teevans/noter-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/teevans/noter-api)

Noter is a simple application designed to showcase a basic CRUD application.

Currently a WIP. Will update with more information as features are implemented.


## Pain Points

- Testing - Testing should be optimized. Right now E2E tests are running, and re-authorizing the user for each test. Reorganizing this would shrink testing time down a few seconds.
